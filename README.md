# memories
A project to share photos, memories and talks.
In this mini app:

- I use Django Channels for WebSocket support.

- I use WebSockets to send and receive real-time updates like likes, comments, or new posts notifications.

- I use regular HTTP/REST (via Django views or DRF) for initial data loading, image uploading, and main navigation.
